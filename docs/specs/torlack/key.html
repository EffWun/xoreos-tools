<title>The KEY file in Neverwinter Nights</title>
</head>

<h3>What is a KEY File?</h3>

<p>The KEY file in Neverwinter Nights (NWN) is used to provide the game with a
centralized location for locating resources contained in the BIF files. To the
best of my knowledge, only one file, &quot;chitin.key&quot; uses this file
format.</p>
<p>The KEY file format is very basic.&nbsp; It consists a header and two large
tables.&nbsp; At the start of the file is the header.&nbsp; It provides
information about the file format, the file format version, offset and size
information about the two tables.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Offset</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0000</td>
      <td>char [4]</td>
      <td>4 byte signature (&quot;KEY &quot;)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0004</td>
      <td>char [4]</td>
      <td>4 byte version (&quot;V1&nbsp; &quot;)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0008</td>
      <td>UINT32</td>
      <td>Number of BIF files referenced in the key file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x000C</td>
      <td>UINT32</td>
      <td>Number of resources (RES) contained in the key file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0010</td>
      <td>UINT32</td>
      <td>Offset from the start of the file to the first BIF entry</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0014</td>
      <td>UINT32</td>
      <td>Offset from the start of the file to the first RES entry</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0018</td>
      <td>UINT32 [10]</td>
      <td>Unknown</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td colspan="2">Total Structure Size</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>One of the two tables of interest to us is the BIF table.&nbsp; This table
lists the all of the BIF files contained in the NWN data directory.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Offset</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0000</td>
      <td>UINT32</td>
      <td>Length of the BIF file in bytes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0004</td>
      <td>UINT32</td>
      <td>Offset from the start of the KEY file to the BIF file name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0008</td>
      <td>UINT16</td>
      <td>Length of the BIF file name in bytes.&nbsp; Not including the
        terminating 0.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x000A</td>
      <td>UINT16</td>
      <td>Unknown</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x000C</td>
      <td colspan="2">Total Structure Size</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>The final table lists all of the resources contained within the BIF
files.&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>Offset</td>
      <td>Type</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0000</td>
      <td>char [16]</td>
      <td>Name of the resource</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0010</td>
      <td>UINT16</td>
      <td>Type of the resource</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0012</td>
      <td>UINT32</td>
      <td>BIF id of the resource</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0x0016</td>
      <td colspan="2">Total Structure Size</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>NOTE: It is very important that the structure packing for this structure is
set to BYTE or WORD alignment.&nbsp; Failure to do so will cause the UINT32 at
offset 0x0012 to be placed at 0x0014 and thus yield buggy functionality.&nbsp;
On non-Intel platforms, this alignment will cause alignment faults unless the
compiler has a &quot;unaligned&quot; type or special care is made when accessing
the UINT32.</p>
<p>When NWN needs to locate a resource, it can be done just using the resource
name.&nbsp; If the name is used by more than one resource type, then the type
would also be required to locate the resource.&nbsp; To locate the resource, the
RES table is be searched for a match.&nbsp; Once a match has been located, the
BIF id of the resource gives the exact location of the resource.</p>
<p>A BIF id is actually two numbers combined into one UINT32.&nbsp; The first 20
bits starting from bit 0 specify the resource index inside the bif.&nbsp; The
final 12 bits specify the BIF in the BIF table contained within the KEY
file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Example: Suppose NWN needed to locate the resource
&quot;IT_GOLD001&quot;.&nbsp; It would start by searching the RES table for the
entry &quot;IT_GOLD001&quot;.&nbsp; Once located in the RES table, the BIF id is
examined.&nbsp; Suppose with BIF id is 0x00400029.&nbsp; The lower 20 bits of
the BIF id tell NWN that the &quot;IT_GOLD001&quot; resource is the 0x29th or
41st resource in the BIF file.&nbsp; From the upper 12 bits, NWN knows that the
4th BIF file contains the resource.&nbsp; So, the 4th record is examined in the
BIF table.&nbsp; This yields the file name for the BIF.&nbsp; The BIF can then
be opened and the 41st resource read from the file.&nbsp; (Information on how
the 41st resource in the BIF file is located will be covered in the BIF file
paper.)</p>
